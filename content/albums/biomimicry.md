Biomicry is a co-compositional musical system that analyses improvisational input using audio
descriptors. The system assesses changes in amplitude and timbre in order to shape its
interactive behaviour. Biomimicry is designed to mimic and follow its human counterpart,
however, its digital memory is also programmed to occassionally fail and this tension fosters an
interactive behaviour that weaves between intelligble and chaotic. Five distinct instances of
Biomimicry were recorded with <a href="https://danoconnor.xyz">Dan O'Connor</a> and
<a href="https://sagepbbbt.com">Sage Pbbbt</a>, which were distributed as the debut release of
the system and its corresponding EP through the wonderful new music label
<a href="https://www.tonelist.com.au">Tone List</a>.
