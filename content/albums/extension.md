Extension is a collection of responses to the two pieces in my previous album <a href="https://jamesbradbury.bandcamp.com/album/interferences?label=2168799842&tab=music">Interferences</a>. I haven't named these 8 works affectionately or with sentimentality. Each one is a different experiment - results of my working through different processes from trying to manage contained and short structures that lack strong narrative characteristics. In contrast to my usual way of working, there is very little involvement of machine intervention in how these works came to be. Sounds were gathered intuitively and kept as close to their raw forms as possible.
