I am a creative-coder and artist from Perth, Western Australia currently living in Berlin. I enjoy programming in my practice often harnessing the computer to find and organise audio-samples through machine listening and learning. I used to work as a Research Fellow in Creative Coding on the [Fluid Corpus Manipulation](https://www.flucoma.org/) project. I now work at Ableton on Research and Development. I'm currently working on projects with [Mark Fell](https://markfell.com/wiki/) and [Rian Treanor](http://www.riantreanor.com) at [https://intersymmetric.xyz](https://intersymmetric.xyz), as well as creating devices with [MONOMONO](https://monomono.audio).
