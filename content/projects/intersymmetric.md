_Intersymmetric_ is a system / instrument / collection of works that explore collaborative musical exploration in the browser. When users connect, the experience they have on the screen is exactly the same as what someone else sees. When they change a dial, hit a button, or swipe their finger over a grid, those changes are reflected in every other participant's instance. I've been working on it with both [Mark Fell](https://markfell.com) and [Rian Treanor](https://riantreanor.com) since 2021. The project lives at [https://intersymmetric.xyz](https://intersymmetric.xyz), where you can experiment with the different iterations of the software yourself.

We've deployed it in a few different contexts:

- [Algorithmic Art Gathering](https://clab.org.tw/en/events/minimal_input_2022_screening/), Taiwan (2022)
- Nyege Nyege Festival, Uganda (2022)
- No Bounds Festival, No Bounds (2022)
- [Algorithmic Art Assembly](https://aaassembly.org/bios/fell.html), San Francisco (2022)

Among these more traditional performance environments, the Intersymmetric technology is being used as an educational tool to give young kids positive experiences with electronic music and to make inviting spaces for people to engage with ways of making music they might never have had the opportunity to try. Given its all living in the browser, the barrier to entry is really low and we've explored lots of different ways that simple interfaces bring the musical ideas to life. You can see below a rehearsal where people from the UK with visual impairments use Intersymmetric to jam together.

We also orchestrated a performance across [Higger Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higger_Tor), [Yorkshire Artspace](https://artspace.org.uk) in Sheffield, Rian's Nan's house in Rotherham and [Hope Works](https://hope-works.co.uk) in Sheffield.

All three of us did a panel to talk about it as part of Algorithmic Art Assembly which you can watch here.

Rian also [interviewed with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/03/rian-treanor-the-producer-hacking-a-smarter-kinder-future-for-music) to discuss it.
